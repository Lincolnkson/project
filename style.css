Appeal mail request:

Dear Deanne
I am submitting this appeal to request a reconsideration of the dismissal recommendation and acknowledging my actions while presenting a clear path forward for resolution. I acknowledge the seriousness of the situation and wish to present reasons why this outcome should be reviewed.

MITIGATING CIRCUMSTANCES
I recognize the gravity of my actions and wish to provide context for my behaviors:
1.	Contract Concerns and Communication Breakdown My decision to discontinue services stemmed from prolonged unresolved contract uncertainties. While I acknowledge my approach was inappropriate, my intention was not to disrupt operations but to seek clarity on my professional status.
2.	Client Communication Misunderstanding My direct communication with the client was motivated by a misguided attempt to ensure transparency. I now understand this circumvented proper professional protocols and potentially compromised the company's reputation.
PROFESSIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN
To address the identified issues and demonstrate my commitment to the organization, I propose the following:
IMMEDIATE CORRECTIVE ACTIONS:
•	Formal written apology to the management
•	Complete retraining on communication protocols
•	Accept full responsibility for my inappropriate actions
•	Implement strict adherence to organizational communication channels
PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT COMMITMENTS:
1.	Communication and Professional Conduct
•	Complete conflict resolution and professional etiquette training
2.	Organizational Protocol Mastery
•	Comprehensive review of company communication guidelines
•	Monthly check-ins with HR to ensure compliance
•	Create personal accountability checklist for professional interactions
3.	Client Relationship Management
•	Shadow senior team members in client communication
•	Develop structured approach to addressing professional concerns


Years of Commitment and Service
For nine years, I have devoted myself to this organisation across various roles, consistently delivering results and taking on extra responsibilities when required. My official roles include Desktop Support, Technical Support Engineer, Technical Support Consultant, Conversational Engineer, and Junior Full Stack Software Engineer.
Beyond these positions, I stepped into additional duties to ensure business continuity during challenging times, such as:
•	Managing headset sales and inventory for internal and external clients nationwide.
-	Kept records of headsets assignments to agents and team leaders for all the regions within South Africa.
-	Kept records of damaged headsets across different campaigns and regions and sent them for repairs.
-	Managed the headsets sales, me being the point of contact when orders are placed, for internal clients (contact centre campaigns) and external client. The most revenue made in a month was just over R 300 000 for the department and the lowest being R 30 000.
•	Acting as a Technical Lead, overseeing project deployments and resolving client issues.
-	Play a huge role in onboarding, Lead project deployments, support and troubleshooting and was the point of contact for the following clients until last year 2023 when the team expended:
	Capitec Bank
	Thabaletsi
	Discovery
	LegalWise
	Legal&Tax
	Oxbridge academy
	Netflorist
	And More
-	The revenue from the above enabled the ConversationalAI team expansion, in tern enabling my to pursue my life long interest in software development.
•	Administering and training staff on the HR recruitment system across multiple countries.
-	Deployment and administered the Talentlink ATS platform for South Africa, Nigeria, Ghana, India, Bostwana, Egypted and more.
-	Training the recruitment staff according to the individual country recruitment processes.
•	Low code developer via the Microsoft power platform.
-	Developed and managed the contract management system used by the legal team from the past 3 years to date. Which also handles the business’s licences and renewals.
-	Developed and manage several SharePoint sites for the business:
	The Conversational AI management site. For storing department passwords, vendor escalation processes and alerts to manage the Liveperson platform accounts.
	The document repository site for the Digital solutions department.
	The CSS reporting data repository.
	There are other’s but just wanted to mention the notable ones above.
My record reflects a history of reliability, flexibility, and dedication to the company’s success. I believe this background demonstrates my value to the business and merits another chance to address concerns raised during the disciplinary process.
________________________________________
Risk to Ongoing Operations
Since transitioning to the junior developer role in April, since there is no documentation for the Conversational Ai Outsystems integrations, as a result had to learn on the go and hence some of the challenges the department had. I have been working alone from the development perspective on the below integrations and currently in the process of documenting them and doing knowledge transfer to the rest of the team. These integrations have varying complexities and relate to undocumented processes between iSON, iSON client and vendors.
My sudden absence will lead to operational risks due to knowledge loss for these integrations.
-	Legal&tax my AI laywer integration.
-	Discovery Campaigns and reporting integrations.
-	Sanlam health proactive campaings(Fedhealth & Bonitas).
-	Multichoice ConnexOne integration.
-	And more
My absence leaves a gap in both expertise and knowledge transfer. Without the necessary documentation or handovers in place, the team will face significant challenges in maintaining these integrations, which could lead to operational delays and harm to the company's reputation.
My experience in this area is unique, and retaining me would prevent disruptions and maintain smooth operations.
There is already a knowledge transfer process Khethani started for the development team which will assist in avoid a single dependency situation. 
I need to be allowed time to create comprehensive documentation for these integrations.

________________________________________
Personal Impact
This decision affects more than just my career. Losing my role would significantly disrupt my ability to support my family and derail the progress I have worked hard to achieve.


REQUEST
I respectfully request an opportunity to:
•	Rectify my professional missteps
•	Continue contributing to the organization
•	Rebuild the trust momentarily compromised by my actions
________________________________________
I am prepared to accept any additional oversight or professional development requirements to demonstrate my genuine commitment. Would like to emphasize that this is my first disciplinary matter in nine years of service. I am ready to take corrective steps and make amends for my actions. My hope is to have the opportunity to demonstrate my commitment to the company and rebuild trust.
Thank you for considering this appeal.
Sincerely,
Lincoln Kgotsoka
